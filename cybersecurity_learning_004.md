🔹 Window's User Account Control

    To protect the local user with such privileges, Microsoft introduced User Account Control (UAC). When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run. 
    
🔹 lusrmgr.msc

    You can see two folders in this command: Users and Groups.
    If you click on Groups, you see all the names of the local groups along with a brief description for each group. Each group has permissions set to it, and users are assigned/added to groups by the Administrator. When a user is assigned to a group, the user inherits the permissions of that group. A user can be assigned to multiple groups.

üèõÔ∏è Key Concepts and Lessons Learned
üîπ Evaluation of Information in Search Engines

    It is our job, as readers, to evaluate the information. We will mention a few things to consider when evaluating information:

    Source: Identify the author or organization publishing the information. Consider whether they are reputable and authoritative on the subject matter. Publishing a blog post does not make one an authority on the subject.
    Evidence and reasoning: Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning. We are seeking hard facts and solid arguments.
    Objectivity and bias: Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, reflecting multiple perspectives. We are not interested in authors pushing shady agendas, whether to promote a product or attack a rival.
    Corroboration and consistency: Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources. Check whether multiple reliable and reputable sources agree on the central claims.

üîπ Google Search Operators

    "exact phrase": Double quotes indicate that you are looking for pages with the exact word or phrase. For example, one might search for "passive reconnaissance" to get pages with this exact phrase.
    site:: This operator lets you specify the domain name to which you want to limit your search. For example, we can search for success stories on TryHackMe using site:tryhackme.com success stories.
    -: The minus sign allows you to omit search results that contain a particular word or phrase. For example, you might be interested in learning about the pyramids, but you don‚Äôt want to view tourism websites; one approach is to search for pyramids -tourism or -tourism pyramids.
    filetype:: This search operator is indispensable for finding files instead of web pages. Some of the file types you can search for using Google are Portable Document Format (PDF), Microsoft Word Document (DOC), Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet (XLS), and Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation (PPT). For example, to find cyber security presentations, try searching for filetype:ppt cyber security.

üîπ Specialized Search Operators

    Censys: focuses on Internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and other Internet assets. 

    VirusTotal: VirusTotal is an online website that provides a virus-scanning service for files using multiple antivirus engines. 

    Have I Been Pwned: It tells you if an email address has appeared in a leaked data breach. 

üîπ Vulnerabilities and Exploits Search

    CVE: a dictionary of vulnerabilities. It provides a standardized identifier for vulnerabilities and security issues in software and hardware products.

    Exploit Database: lists exploit codes from various authors; some of these exploit codes are tested and marked as verified.

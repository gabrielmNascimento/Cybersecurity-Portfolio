🏛️ Key Concepts and Lessons Learned
🔹 System Configuration Tab

    There is a list of various utilities (tools) in the Tools tab that we can run to configure the operating system further. There is a brief description of each tool to provide some insight into what the tool is for. 
    
🔹 Event Viewer

    Event Viewer has three panes.

    The pane on the left provides a hierarchical tree listing of the event log providers. (as shown in the image above)
    The pane in the middle will display a general overview and summary of the events specific to a selected provider.
    The pane on the right is the actions pane.

  🔹Resource Monitor
  
    Per Microsoft, "Resource Monitor displays per-process and aggregate CPU, memory, disk, and network usage information, in addition to providing details about which processes are using individual file handles and modules. Advanced filtering allows users to isolate the data related to one or more processes (either applications or services), start, stop, pause, and resume services, and close unresponsive applications from the user interface. It also includes a process analysis feature that can help identify deadlocked processes and file locking conflicts so that the user can attempt to resolve the conflict instead of closing an application and potentially losing data."

🏛️ Key Concepts and Lessons Learned
🔹 Defensive Security vs. Offensive Security

    Offensive (Red Team): Exploits systems to find vulnerabilities.

    Defensive (Blue Team): Builds protection mechanisms and responds to threats.

🔹 Blue Team Responsibilities

    Cybersecurity awareness for users

    Asset inventory and documentation

    Patch management

    Network defense via firewalls and intrusion prevention systems

    Logging and monitoring for threat detection

🔹 Security Operations Center (SOC)

    The SOC team monitors and protects the organization’s infrastructure.

    Main responsibilities:

        Detect policy violations

        Spot unauthorized activity

        Respond to intrusions

    Uses tools like SIEM to collect and analyze security events.

🔹 Threat Intelligence

    Involves gathering data on potential attackers and their tactics.

    Helps develop a threat-informed defense.

🔹 DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)

    Digital Forensics:

        Investigates storage devices, system memory, logs, and network traffic to find traces of malicious activity.

🔹 Malware Analysis

    Ransomware, viruses, and Trojans are key malware types.

    Analysis methods:

        Static Analysis: Review code without executing.

        Dynamic Analysis: Execute in a sandbox to observe behavior.
